# trains

This is a project where I intend to apply some project patterns, understand better the Vue framework, perform researches and tests related to cloud environments, specially AWS, and also to keep myself alive during my time off. :)

The project uses the Phaser framework, which probably is not the best fit for Vue, but that's why it was choosen. The idea is to have a close-to-real scenario where the things are not pre-aligned and the frameworks we need to combine were not planned to work together.

Feel free to contribute with suggestions, questions, or even code.
